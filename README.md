# The Martian Company's Javascript File System Module (`@themartiancompany/fs`)

[![NPM version](
  https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@themartiancompany/fs.svg)](
    https://npmjs.org/package/@themartiancompany/fs)

Platform-independent Javascript File System `fs` module,
which dynamically loads either the platform's native
`fs` module or the
[Origin Private File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/opfs)
(OPFS) module.

## Installation

To build the Node module package from source run

```bash
$ make \
    all
```

A `thmartiancompany-fs-<version>.tgz` archive
will be generated in the root of the repository.

To install the module system-wide run

```bash
# make \
    install-npm
```

To install it as a
[DogeOS](
  https://githubcom/themartiancompany/dogeos)
system package from the
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
uncensorable user repository and application
store run

```bash
ur \
  "nodejs-fs"
```

A mirror of the Ur universal recipe
has been made available on The Martian
Company's Github at
[`nodejs-opfs-ur`](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/nodejs-opfs-ur).

To download the library from
the NPM Registry run

```bash
npm \
  install \
  --save \
    "@themartiancompany/opfs"
```

### Documentation

For API documentation
refer to the
[Happy OPFS](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/happy-opfs/blob/main/docs/README.md),
[OPFS Tools](
  https://github.com/hughfenghen/opfs-tools/blob/main/docs/api.md) and
[File System API](
  https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html).

Usage manual is located in `man` in reStructured
text format and can be accessed upon module
installation with

```bash
man \
  "tmcfs"
```

If you are looking for an example of how
to write a full computer application
composed of only Bash programs and
Node modules but which runs the
same and with zero modifications
regardless of whether it has available
for display a terminal or a browser window,
you can look at the
[Ahsi](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ahsi)
program, written using the
[Crash Javascript](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-js)
and
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
libraries.

Refer to the Ahsi repository for more information
about installing and running it.
