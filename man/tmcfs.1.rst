The Martian Company's Javascript File System Module
=====================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------
The Martian Company Javascript File System module
-----------------------------------------------------------
:Version: tmcfs |version|
:Manual section: 1

Synopsis
========


..  code-block:: javascript

  const
    _fs =
      require(
        "@themartiancompany/fs");



Description
===========

This is the man page for the system-wide version
of The Martian Company's platform-independent
Javascript File System module *@themartiancompany/fs*,
which dynamically loads at runtime an appropriate
native file system module.

Usage
=========

In order for a standard *fs*-using module
to seamlessly work in a browser, just
declare using webpack,
just add *@themartiancompany/fs* to its
dependencies and declare the module
a fallback for the *fs* module.

Be also sure to add as a dependency
the appropriate file system module for
the environment the program is supposed
to run in.

For example in a *webpack.config.cjs* file.

..  code-block:: javascript

  const
    _path =
      require(
        "path");
  module.exports = {
    entry:
      './my-node-module',
    output:
      _output,
    optimization: {
      moduleIds: 'deterministic',
    },
    resolve: {
      fallback: {
        "fs":
          _path.resolve(
            __dirname,
            'node_modules/@themartiancompany/fs/fs'),
        "path":
          false,
        "@std/path":
          _path.resolve(
            __dirname,
            'node_modules/@std/path/mod.js')
      },
    },
  };

If you stumbled upon this module because
you want to run your Javascript programs anywhere
and prefer a Bash-like style for your
code and you are looking for
a library which allows exactly the same workflow
of a Bash script with zero code changes, the Crash
Javascript [1]_ library is probably what you
are looking for.
